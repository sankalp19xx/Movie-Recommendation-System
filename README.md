# Movie-Recommendation-System
Earlier companies were not able to gain and retain customers insights and know users interests which would engage the users for a very long time and hence they could not show more ads to catch more clients.

The user starts to feel known and understood and is more likely to buy additional products or consume more content. By knowing what a user wants, the company gains competitive advantage and the threat of losing a customer to a competitor decreases.Providing that added value to users by including recommendations in systems and products is appealing. Furthermore, it allows companies to position ahead of their competitors and eventually increase their earnings.

This project aims to predict interests of customers and recommend movies that quite likely are interesting for them. What is more, companies are able to gain and retain customers by sending out emails with links to new offers that meet the recipientsâ€™ interests, or suggestions of films and TV shows that suit their profiles.
